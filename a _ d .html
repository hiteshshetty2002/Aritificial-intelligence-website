<b><u>ADVANTAGES:</u></b><br>
1.HIGH ACCURACY WITH LESS ERRORS:AI machines or systems are prone to less errors and high accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information.<br>
2.HIGH-SPEED :AI systems can be of very high speed-and fast?decision making,because of that AI systems can beaat a chess champion in the chess game.<br>
3.HIGH-RELIABILITY:AI machines are hihly reliable and can perrform the same action multiple times with high accuracy.
4.USEFUL FOR RISKY AREAS:AI machines can be helpful in situations such as diffusing a bomb,exploring the ocean floor,wher to employee a human can be risky.<br>

Every technology has some disadvantages and the same goes for artificial intelligent. being so advantageous technology still,it has some disadvantages:<br>
1.HIGH COST:the hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintainnce to meet current world requirements.<br>
2.CAN'T THINK OUT OF BOX: even we are making smarter machine with AI, but still they can not work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained or programmed.<br>
3.NO FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS: AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachement with human, may sometime 
be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.<br>
4.INCREASE DEPENDENCEY ON MACHINES: with the increment of technology, people are getting more dependent on devices and hence they are losing they mental capabilities.<br>
5.NO ORIGIONAL CREATIVITY :  as humans are so creative and can imane some new idea but still AI machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.<br>
